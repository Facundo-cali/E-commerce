# E-commerce
My project is an e-commerce website that uses a variety of technologies, including HTML, CSS, MySQL, Express, Node, JavaScript, and Sequelize. The website allows users to register and log in to their account, search for products, create new products with images, edit and delete products, and more.

The website uses MySQL to store product information and user data. Node.js and Express are used to handle server-side logic, while Sequelize is used as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the MySQL database.

The user interface of the website is designed using HTML and CSS, with JavaScript being used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the website. The website also features a search bar that allows users to search for products by keyword or category.

In addition, the website includes a product management system that allows authorized users to create, edit, and delete products, along with uploading images for each product. The website also includes a registration and login system to ensure secure access to user accounts.

Overall, the website provides a complete e-commerce solution that enables users to browse, search, and purchase products in a secure and user-friendly environment.
